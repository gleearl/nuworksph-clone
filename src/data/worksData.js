It organizes daily tasks into a simple to-do list, and storeowners can win points for rewards every time they tick off an item. It also speeds up months of surveying stock count and checking prices and provides a unique way for PMI to engage partner storeowners!",
                impact: "WIth PMI APPWARDS' simple interface, stock counting and checking prices were transformed into an intuitive game, making it easy and fun for the sar-sari store owners. From 9-10 hours per day, PMI employees only spent 8 minutes and 42 seconds average on inventory tasks in-store (including travel time). This allowed PMI to focus on helping over 1,000 sari-sari store owners save time. Say hello to the future of tech-driven sari-sari stores, powered by APPWARDS."
